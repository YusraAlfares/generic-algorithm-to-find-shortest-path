# Implementation of Genetic and A* Algorithms for Path Planning in Grid-Based environment 

## Overview
This project is about implementing the genetic and A* algorithms to find the shortest path in a grid based environment. 
It must navigate from the start position to the goal position, where the obstacles can be changed regarding each test run. 
Me and my team tested our code on 10% to 90% obstacle density, where 10%'s output was the fastest and 90%'s output took more time than we expected. 

## Course details 
This course was about Artificial intelligence, where we were introduced with different types of agents and how do they work, and different algorithms like the A*, genetic, and many more algorithms
